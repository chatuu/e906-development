\begin{abstract}
\noindent This document outlines the methodology for determining the dimuon reconstruction efficiency required for the Drell-Yan double-differential cross-section measurement. Efficiency correction factors are derived using Monte Carlo simulations and applied to experimental data. The efficiency $\epsilon$ is parameterized as a function of the kinematic variables, Feynman-x ($x_F$) and dimuon invariant mass ($m$). We detail the procedure for calculating the average efficiency $\langle\epsilon\rangle$ for each kinematic bin by applying a linear interpolation method to data events. The propagation of statistical uncertainties is rigorously derived, and the final correction factors, $1/\langle\epsilon\rangle$, are presented for different datasets and target configurations.

\section{Introduction}
We report DY absolute double differntial cross-section for different Mass and $x_{F}$ bins. It is necessary to correct the reconstruction efficiency for different $x_{F}$ and Mass bins using Monte-Carlo events. In this study we first generate efficiency curves for different Mass and $x_{F}$ bins and then calculate average efficiency $<\epsilon>$ using the methodology developped by Harsha and iterating through data (RS67, RS57-70) for each 2-dimensional bin range. Then the correction factor: $1/<\epsilon>$ will be applied when calculating cross-section.

\subsection{Dimuon Events Used}
Following files were used to calculate kTracker efficiency for different Mass and $x_{F}$ bins:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Following Monte-Carlo files were used to generate efficiency curves for different Mass and $x_{F}$ bins:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item mc\_drellyan\_LH2\_M027\_S002\_messy\_occ\_pTxFweight\_v2.root
  \item mc\_drellyan\_LH2\_M027\_S002\_clean\_occ\_pTxFweight\_v2.root
 \end{itemize}
 \item Following data files were used to calculate average efficiency for different Mass and $x_{F}$ bins:
 \begin{itemize}
	 \item R008\_roadset67\_0\_2111v42\_tmp\_noPhys\_noOcc.parquet
  \item roadset57\_70\_R008\_2111v42\_tmp\_noPhys.parquet
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


The reconstruction efficiency curves were generated for different Mass and $x_{F}$ bins by taking the ratio: 
$$Efficiency\ (\epsilon) = \frac{Number\ of\ messy\ dimuon\ events}{Number\ of\ clean\ dimuon\ events}$$ 
that passes all event selection cuts. This is calculated as a function of the D2 variable, binned in Feynman-x ($x_F$) and dimuon mass ($m$).

\subsection{Bin ranges}
This efficiency study is conducted by using the same bin ranges defined in Shivangi's cross-section script.
Following bins widths are defined to calculate efficiency corrections.
\begin{itemize}
 \item $x_{F}$ bins: [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85]
 \item Mass bins: [4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.4, 5.7, 6.0, 6.3, 6.6, 6.9, 7.5, 8.7]

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Event Selection}
Following event selection criteria applied to Monte-Carlo events mentioned in section. I am using the same event selection criteria defined by Hugo's analysis.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Event selection applied to messy events:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Base cuts: chuckCutsPositive\_2111v42\_tmp \&\& chuckCutsNegative\_2111v42\_tmp \&\& chuckCutsDimuon\_2111v42 \&\& physicsCuts\_noMassCut\_2111v42\_tmp \&\& occCuts\_2111v42 \&\& DYCut\_MC
   \item xF cut
   \item mass cut
  \end{itemize}
 \item Event selection applied to clean events:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Base cuts: chuckCutsPositive\_2111v42\_tmp \&\& chuckCutsNegative\_2111v42\_tmp \&\& chuckCutsDimuon\_2111v42 \&\& physicsCuts\_noMassCut\_2111v42\_tmp \&\& DYCut\_MC
   \item xF cut
   \item mass cut
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Determination of Efficiency for a Dimuon Event}
In order to determine efficiency for each dimuon event in data, I use the same methodology developped by Harsha.

    \caption{Determination of Efficiency and it's uncertainty}
    \label{fig:error_propagation_concept}
\end{figure}


The given formula for the efficiency, denoted by $\epsilon_{t,d_{2}}$, is a function of $\epsilon_{t,d_{+}}$, $\epsilon_{t,d_{-}}$, $d_+$, $d_-$, and $d_2$:
$$
\epsilon_{t,d_{2}} = \epsilon_{t,d_{-}} - \frac{\epsilon_{t,d_{+}} - \epsilon_{t,d_{-}}}{d_+ - d_-} (d_2 - d_-)
$$
Our goal is to find the uncertainty of $\epsilon_{t,d_{2}}$, denoted as $\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{2}}$, assuming we know the uncertainties $\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{+}}$ and $\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{-}}$. The terms $d_2$, $d_+$, and $d_-$ are treated as constants with no associated uncertainty.

\subsubsection{Error Propagation Method}

For a function of multiple variables, such as $\epsilon_{t,d_{2}}(\epsilon_{t,d_{+}}, \epsilon_{t,d_{-}})$, the general formula to propagate uncertainty (assuming the variables are uncorrelated) is:
$$
(\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{2}})^2 = \left(\frac{\partial \epsilon_{t,d_{2}}}{\partial \epsilon_{t,d_{+}}}\right)^2 (\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{+}})^2 + \left(\frac{\partial \epsilon_{t,d_{2}}}{\partial \epsilon_{t,d_{-}}}\right)^2 (\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{-}})^2
$$

% --- Section 3: Step-by-Step Derivation ---

\subsubsection{Step-by-Step Derivation}

To find the final uncertainty, we follow three main steps.

\subsubsection{Simplify the Expression for $\epsilon_{t,d_{2}}$}

To make the calculation of derivatives more straightforward, we first rearrange the formula for $\epsilon_{t,d_{2}}$:
$$
\epsilon_{t,d_{2}} = \epsilon_{t,d_{-}} - \left(\frac{d_2 - d_-}{d_+ - d_-}\right)\epsilon_{t,d_{+}} + \left(\frac{d_2 - d_-}{d_+ - d_-}\right)\epsilon_{t,d_{-}}
$$
Combining the terms that contain $\epsilon_{t,d_{-}}$, we get:
$$
\epsilon_{t,d_{2}} = \left(1 + \frac{d_2 - d_-}{d_+ - d_-}\right)\epsilon_{t,d_{-}} - \left(\frac{d_2 - d_-}{d_+ - d_-}\right)\epsilon_{t,d_{+}}
$$
We can find a common denominator for the term multiplying $\epsilon_{t,d_{-}}$:
$$
\epsilon_{t,d_{2}} = \left(\frac{d_+ - d_- + d_2 - d_-}{d_+ - d_-}\right)\epsilon_{t,d_{-}} - \left(\frac{d_2 - d_-}{d_+ - d_-}\right)\epsilon_{t,d_{+}}
$$
This simplifies to:
$$
\epsilon_{t,d_{2}} = \left(\frac{d_+ + d_2 - 2d_-}{d_+ - d_-}\right)\epsilon_{t,d_{-}} - \left(\frac{d_2 - d_-}{d_+ - d_-}\right)\epsilon_{t,d_{+}}
$$

\subsubsection{Calculate the Partial Derivatives}

With the simplified expression, we can now find the partial derivatives of $\epsilon_{t,d_{2}}$ with respect to $\epsilon_{t,d_{+}}$ and $\epsilon_{t,d_{-}}$.

\paragraph{Derivative with respect to $\epsilon_{t,d_{+}}$:}
$$
\frac{\partial \epsilon_{t,d_{2}}}{\partial \epsilon_{t,d_{+}}} = -\frac{d_2 - d_-}{d_+ - d_-} = \frac{d_- - d_2}{d_+ - d_-}
$$

\paragraph{Derivative with respect to $\epsilon_{t,d_{-}}$:}
$$
\frac{\partial \epsilon_{t,d_{2}}}{\partial \epsilon_{t,d_{-}}} = \frac{d_+ + d_2 - 2d_-}{d_+ - d_-}
$$

\subsubsection{Uncertainty Formula for one di-muon event}

Finally, we substitute these partial derivatives back into the error propagation formula:
$$
(\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{2}})^2 = \left(\frac{d_- - d_2}{d_+ - d_-}\right)^2 (\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{+}})^2 + \left(\frac{d_+ + d_2 - 2d_-}{d_+ - d_-}\right)^2 (\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{-}})^2
$$
Taking the square root of both sides gives the final expression for the uncertainty, $\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{2}}$:
$$
\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{2}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{d_- - d_2}{d_+ - d_-}\right)^2 (\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{+}})^2 + \left(\frac{d_+ + d_2 - 2d_-}{d_+ - d_-}\right)^2 (\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{-}})^2}
$$
This can also be written in a more compact form by factoring out the denominator:
$$
\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{2}} = \frac{1}{|d_+ - d_-|} \sqrt{(d_- - d_2)^2 (\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{+}})^2 + (d_+ + d_2 - 2d_-)^2 (\delta\epsilon_{t,d_{-}})^2}
$$
\clearpage

\subsection{Average efficiency and final uncertainty}
We determine average efficiency by iterating through all the di-muon events. The final efficiency $\bar{\epsilon}$
If you have N dimuon events, each with a calculated efficiency ($\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \dots, \epsilon_N$) and a corresponding error ($\delta\epsilon_1, \delta\epsilon_2, \dots, \delta\epsilon_N$), you first calculate the \textbf{average efficiency}, $\bar{\epsilon}$:
$$
\bar{\epsilon} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \epsilon_i
$$
The \textbf{error on this average efficiency}, which we'll call $\delta\bar{\epsilon}$, is then given by the standard formula for propagation of error for a sum:
$$
\delta\bar{\epsilon} = \frac{1}{N} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\delta\epsilon_i)^2}
$$
This is equivalent to writing the sum of squares explicitly:
$$
\delta\bar{\epsilon} = \sqrt{\frac{(\delta\epsilon_1)^2 + (\delta\epsilon_2)^2 + \dots + (\delta\epsilon_N)^2}{N^2}}
$$

\section{Results}
Here, we report efficiency corrections under 2 scenerios.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Efficiency calculation only by using $x_{F}$ bins (1-D Study)
	\item Efficiency calculation only by using both $x_{F}$ and Mass bins (2-D Study)
\end{itemize}



%\subsection{Generating Efficiency Curves (PDF Plots)}
%The efficiency curves are generated using a ROOT C++ script, `Efficiency\_single\_bin.C', which is executed in parallel for each of the 187 kinematic bins ($17 \times x_F$, $11 \times m$).
%
%The C++ script performs the core task of calculating the efficiency for one specific bin. A Bash script, `run\_parallel.sh`, manages the parallel execution of this C++ script, significantly speeding up the process. The Bash script, shown in Listing~\ref{lst:bash_script}, contains a simple loop.
%
%\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, caption={Excerpt from `run\_parallel.sh` showing the parallel execution loop.}, label={lst:bash_script}]
%#!/bin/bash
%MAX_JOBS=$(nproc)
%XF_BINS=17
%MASS_BINS=11
%
%for ixf in $(seq 0 $(($XF_BINS - 1))); do
%    for imass in $(seq 0 $(($MASS_BINS - 1))); do
%        # Run the ROOT macro in the background for one bin
%        root -l -b -q "Efficiency_single_bin.C($ixf, $imass)" &
%
%        # Pause if the maximum number of jobs is reached
%        if [[ $(jobs -r -p | wc -l) -ge $MAX_JOBS ]]; then
%            wait -n
%        fi
%    done
%done
%wait # Wait for all remaining jobs to finish
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%The output of this process is a collection of PDF files, each showing the efficiency curve for a single bin, as displayed in Section~\ref{sec:plots}.
%
%\subsection{Generating Raw Data Files (.npz)}
%For the subsequent analysis step, the raw data points from the efficiency curves are required. A modified version of the C++ script, `Efficiency\_single\_bin\_npz.C`, is used. This script performs the same efficiency calculation but, instead of creating a plot, it saves the data arrays (D2 values, efficiency values, and asymmetric errors) into a compressed NumPy (`.npz`) file for each bin. This provides a machine-readable format for the Python-based analysis.

% --- METHODOLOGY PART 2 ---
\section{Methodology: Calculating Average Efficiencies}
With the efficiency data saved in `.npz` files, a Python script is used to calculate the average efficiency for a separate dataset of dimuon events. For each event in the dataset, its corresponding efficiency is found by linearly interpolating the efficiency curve from the appropriate $(x_F, m)$ bin. The average efficiency for each bin is then calculated along with its associated errors.

The key quantities are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Average Efficiency ($<\epsilon>$):} The simple arithmetic mean of the interpolated efficiency values, $\epsilon_i$, for all $N$ events in a bin, as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:avg_eff}.
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:avg_eff}
        \langle\epsilon\rangle = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \epsilon_i
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Statistical Error ($\delta_{\text{stat}} <\epsilon>$):} The standard error on the mean of the efficiency distribution within the bin, which quantifies the statistical uncertainty.
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:stat_err}
        \delta_{\text{stat}} \langle\epsilon\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{\langle\epsilon^2\rangle - \langle\epsilon\rangle^2}{N}}
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Propagated Error ($\delta_{\text{prop}} <\epsilon>$):} The error on the average efficiency found by propagating the uncertainties from the original efficiency curve points, $\delta\epsilon_i$.
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:prop_err}
        \delta_{\text{prop}} \langle\epsilon\rangle = \frac{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\delta\epsilon_i)^2}}{N}
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Inverse Average Efficiency ($1/<\epsilon>$):} The reciprocal of the average efficiency, often used in cross-section calculations.

    \item \textbf{Propagated Error of the Inverse ($\delta(1/<\epsilon>)$):} The uncertainty on the inverse efficiency, found using standard error propagation.
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:inv_err}
        \delta(1/\langle\epsilon\rangle) = \frac{\delta_{\text{prop}}\langle\epsilon\rangle}{\langle\epsilon\rangle^2}
    \end{equation}

\section{Disscussion}
We calculated kTracker efficiency correcttions with the propagated uncertainties for different Mass and $x_{F}$ bins by using Monte-Carlo events. 
It is evident that the efficiency corrections for some $x_{F}$ and Mass bins couldn't calculate reliably due to low statistics. 
In some cases we cannot reliably determine the efficiency in these bins; sometimes the efficiency is even larger than one due to the large fluctuations.  
Also in some bins have an efficiency of zero and we have to delete these bins from the final results. 
We have to calculate efficiency curves for these 2D bins with the Monte-Carlo samples with high statistics.
